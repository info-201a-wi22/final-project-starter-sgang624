# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[cleanData.R](./cleanData.R) | Cleaned up dataset. 
|[data_access.R](./data_access.R) | Used to source files. 
|[summaryInfo.R](./summaryInfo.R) | Contains a summary of our dataset. 
|[summaryInfoTable.R](./summaryInfoTable.R) | Contains some summary information about our dataset in the form of a table.
|[plotOne.R](./plotOne.R) | Contains code for our scatterplot, comparing Housing Price Index vs Violent Crime Rate. 
|[plotTwo.R](./plotTwo.R) | Contains code for our stacked bar chart, displaying percentage of major crimes for Housing Price Index under 110.
|[plotThree.R](./plotThree.R) | Contains code for our boxplot, comparing crime percentage at different Housing Price Index groups. 
|[plotFour.R](./plotFour.R) | Contains code for our bar chart, comparing Violent Crime trends over the Years. 



# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
