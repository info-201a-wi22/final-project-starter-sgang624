```

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)\
setwd("../")
source("source/data_access.R")
```

```{r summaryInfo, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
observations <- summary_info$num_observations
features <- summary_info$num_features
min_hpi_value <- summary_info$min_hpi_value
max_hpi_value <- summary_info$max_hpi_value
mean_hpi_value <- summary_info$mean_hpi_value
num_locations <- summary_info$num_city_state
major_crimes <- summary_info$major_crime
```

#This is how you show variable values in the markdown
`r observations`
`r features`
`r min_hpi_value`
`r max_hpi_value`
`r mean_hpi_value`
`r num_locations`
`r major_crimes`

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r Table, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
knitr::kable(table)
```

Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plotOne, echo=FALSE}
plot(plotOne)
```

```{r plotTwo, echo=FALSE}
plot(plotTwo)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
